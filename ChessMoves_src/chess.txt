********************
* Chessboard setup *
********************

At the beginning of the game the chessboard is laid out so that each player has the white (or light) color square in the bottom right-hand side. Each side starts out with 16 pieces, consisting of 8 pawns, 2 rooks, 2 knights, 2 bishops, and a king and a queen, all in the same color, that are arranged the same way each time.

The second row (row 2 for White, row 7 for Black) is filled with pawns. The other pieces are placed on the first row (row 1 for White, row 8 for Black).
The rooks go in the corners, then the knights next to them, followed by the bishops.
The queen always goes on her own matching color (white queen on white, black queen on black), you may also say on the "d" column.
The king goes on the remaining square, which is on the "e" column.
  
After setup, White and Black move alternately, moving one single piece at a time (except for castling; see below). To note, that White always goes first in chess.

**********************
* General move rules *
**********************

Each of the 6 different kinds of pieces moves differently.
Pieces cannot move through other pieces (though the knight can jump over other pieces).
Pieces can never move onto a square with one of their own pieces. 
Pieces can be moved to take the place of an opponent's piece which is then captured.

Pieces are generally moved into positions where they can capture other pieces (by landing on their square and then replacing them), defend their own pieces in case of capture, or control important squares in the game.

*****************************
* Piece specific move rules *
*****************************

Rook chess piece moves.
=======================

The rook piece can move forward, backward, left or right (but not diagonally).
The rook can move anywhere from 1 to 7 squares in any direction, so long as it is not obstructed by any other piece.
The rook can participate in "castling" (see below).

Bishop chess piece moves.
=========================

The bishop may move as far as it wants (so long as it is not obstructed by another piece), but only diagonally.
Each bishop starts on one color (light or dark) and must always stay on that color.

Knight chess piece moves.
=========================

Knights move in a very different way from the other pieces – going two squares in one direction, and then one more move at a 90 degree angle, just like the shape of an “L”.
Knights are the only pieces that can move over other pieces.
Knights can only move to one of up to eight positions on the board.

Queen chess piece moves.
========================

The queen is the most powerful piece. She can move in any one straight direction - forward, backward, sideways, or diagonally - as far as possible as long as she does not move through any of her own pieces.
Like with all pieces, if the queen captures an opponent's piece, her move is over.

Note:
-----
The queen can do all moves of a rook, as well as all those of a bishop.

King chess piece moves.
=======================

The king piece can move one single square in any direction (up, down, to the sides, and diagonally).
The king may never move himself into check (where he could be captured).
The king can participate in "castling" (see below).

Note:
-----
When the king is attacked by another piece, this is called "check". If there is no possibility to put the king out of check (by moving it, by capturing the attacking piece or by moving another piece between the king and the attacking piece), the king is said to be "checkmate" and the game is over (won by the opponent).

Pawn chess piece moves.
=======================

Pawns are unusual because they move and capture in different ways: they move forward, but capture diagonally.
Pawns can only move forward one square at a time, except for their very first move where they can move forward two squares.
Pawns can only capture one square diagonally in front of them.
Pawns can never move or capture backwards.
If there is another piece directly in front of a pawn he cannot move past or capture that piece.
Once a pawn chess piece reaches the other side of the chess board, the pawn is "promoted", what means that the player may "trade" it in for any other chess piece, except another king.

Note:
-----
Under usual conditions, the chess player chooses to promote the pawn into a queen. Thus, starting with one single queen, it's possible, that a player will have two (or more) queens.

**********************
* Special move rules *
**********************

Castling.
=========

Castling is the only chess move, where the player can move 2 pieces: first the king, then the rook.
Castling consists in moving the king two squares over to one side and then moving the rook from that side's corner to right next to the king on the opposite side.
Castling allows you to do two important things all in one move: get your king to safety (hopefully), and get your rook out of the corner and into the game.
Casling may only be done under the following conditions:
  - It must be that king's very first move.
  - It must be that rook's very first move.
  - There cannot be any pieces between the king and rook to move.
  - The king may not be in check or pass through check.

Note:
-----
Castling in the direction, where the king is closer to the side of the board is called castling "kingside". Castling to the other side, through where the queen sat, is called castling "queenside". Regardless of which side, the king always moves only two squares when castling.

"en passant".
=============

"en passant" (French for "in passing") is a special pawn move, that is only allowed under given conditions.
The "en passant" rule says the following: If a pawn moves out two squares on its first move, and by doing so lands to the side of an opponent's pawn (effectively jumping past the other pawn's ability to capture it), that other pawn has the option of capturing the first pawn as it passes by.
"en passant" must be done immediately after the first pawn has moved past, otherwise the option to capture it is no longer available.

Stalemate.
==========

Stalemate is not a chess move, but a chess situation, where the player, whose turn it is to move, is not in check, but has no legal move. This occurs when her only piece left is the king (or, with other pieces remaining, these can't be moved) and all possible moves of the king would set him into check. The rules of chess provide, that when stalemate occurs, the game ends as a draw.
