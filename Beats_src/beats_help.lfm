      'Striking two adjacent keys on a piano produces a warbling combination usually considered to be unpleasant.  The superposition of two waves of  similar but not identical frequencies is the culprit.  Another example is often noticeable in jet aircraft, particularly the two-engine variety,  while taxiing.  The combined sound of the engines goes  up and down in loudness. This varying loudness happens because the sound waves have similar but not identical frequencies. The discordant warbling of the piano and the  fluctuating  loudness of the  jet  engine noise are  both due to  alternately  constructive and  destructive interference as the two waves go in and out of phase.'

      'The wave resulting from the superposition of two similar-frequency waves has a frequency that is the average of the two. This wave fluctuates in amplitude, or beats, with a frequency called the beat frequency. If the two sound waves are defined by the functions y1 = A·cos(2π·f1·t) and y2 = A·cos(2π·f2·t) the function of the wave superposition is defined by:'
