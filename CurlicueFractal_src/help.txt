The curlicue fractal is a fractal credited to Pickover and was first presented in 1995. It is generated by starting with a line segment of unit length and adding to it subsequent line segments of the same length, but different angles. These angles are given by the series
  ϕ[n+1] = (ϕ[n] + θ[n]) % 2π  with ϕ[0] = 0
θ[n+1] is given by
  θ[n+1] = (θ[n] + 2πs) % 2π   with θ[0] = 0
Note that in these formulas % is the "modulo" operator, and s has to be an irrational number (at least to get interesting fractals).

"CurlicueFractal" is a Lazarus/Free Pascal PC application that may be used to draw such fractals. The value of s may be chosen from some typical examples of irrational numbers: π, ϕ (golden ratio), √2, ln(2), e, γ (Euler-Mascheroni constant), δ (Feigenbaum constant), and some others, or entered by the user (choose USER in the combobox to do so).

The user can choose the number of points of the curve to be calculated (typical values are 10,000 and 40,000), as well as the length of the line segment to be added at each iteration (most curves will fit into the drawing area for values between 1 and 4).

For the predefined values of s, the application chooses a custom starting point of the curve, that mostly fits the curve within the drawing area; for user entered values, the starting point is the middle and the center of the drawing area. You can adjust the position on the curve by moving it upwards, downwards, leftwards and rightwards by pushing the corresponding button.
