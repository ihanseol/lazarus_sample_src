Mineral chemistry exercise generator: Nomenclature of ionic compounds.
======================================================================

Notes concerning the compounds and their names:

1. The compounds are generated by adding an anion and a cation from those available in the
   corresponding files. The resulting compound does not necessarily exist in "real life".
2. The names expected by the application are the most commonly used, and may be different
   from the IUPAC name. Thus, entering a correct IUPAC name may be evaluated as false answer!
3. For compounds with the hydrogen anion, the application expects the name of the compound in
   aqueous solution, i.e. the name of the acid.
