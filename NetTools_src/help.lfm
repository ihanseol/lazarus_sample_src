      '"NetTools" is not a network program by itself, but a graphical user interface for the most common MS Windows build-in networking command line tools. The application allows you to run these tools by clicking a button, to view the tool''s output in a command-prompt-like window and to save this output to a (text) file.'

      'When "NetTools" starts up, it looks for the file "nettools.txt", containing the paths of the different tools. If this file does not exist, or a tool has no path set in this file, the application searches some Windows directories (in particular C:\Windows\System32) in order to find the tool (an executable with the same name as the one indicated for the tool). If, for some tool, no program has been found, a message is displayed and this tool will not be available. "NetTools" was tested on Windows 10, where all tools (except Whois, cf. below) are present. I think, that even on older versions of Windows, all of them should be there.'
      'The application then tries to determine your actual networking parameters: the name of your computer (running hostname.exe), the MAC addresses (running getmac; this does not tell which network card a MAC belongs to), the internal IP address of your ethernet and WiFi network card (runnung ipconfig) and your actual external IP address (cf. below). If you are connected to the Internet, all this information should be displayed and you can now run the (available) tools.'

      'Whois is not part of the MS Windows build-in porograms and thus you''ll probably get a warning message, that whois.exe has not be found, when you run "NetTools". However, Whois actually is a Microsoft program and is part of MS Sysinternals, a package of system administraton tools (http://www.sysinternals.com/). You can download the whole package, or if you prefer, directly download Whois alone from https://download.sysinternals.com/files/WhoIs.zip. The archive contains both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions. Move the executable (best to use whois64.exe) to whereever you want, open "Tools" in the "File" menu and use the "Browse" button next to "Whois" to tell the application, where the tool is located.'

      'There are several neetworking packages for Lazarus, but I didn''t succeed in installing them. As workaround to having no Free Pascal method to get the external IP, I used another, finally very easy approach to find it. Curl is a MS Windows build-in command line webbrowser (similar to wget) and I used curl to go to http://dynupdate.no-ip.com/ip.php. This script returns the IP of the computer, that did the HTTP request. Thus, to get the external IP, nothing more to do than to read the console output of Curl.'
