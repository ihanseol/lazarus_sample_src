=======================

SearchMP3 is an application to search for .mp3 files on the local computer. Search may be done either based on file properties or
on the values of the MP3 tags (which must be set in this case, of course).

Search criteria selection window.
=================================

 1. Choose the directory where the search has to be done (default = user's Music directory); include subdirectories in search or not.
 2. Choose if you want to search the file properties or the MP3 tags by checking the corresponding radio button.
 3. Choose which information you want to use for searching (note that if you check several criteria, the file has to meet all of them).
    3a. Searching using the file properties:
	     - file name
		 - file date (file date: input value = a given date OR file time: input value = a given number of days passed)
		 - file size (in megabytes)
    3b. Searching using MP3 tags:
	     - artist name
		 - album name
		 - track name
		 - music genre (you may choose from those included in the list or enter a value as you need)
		 - release year
		 - play time (NOT IMPLEMENTED in version 1.0)
		Note that when simultanously searching album and track title, the file is supposeed to need to meet either one or the other
		criterium.

 4. Click the "Search" button to open the search results window.
 
 Options menu: Search, dipslay and other settings.
 -------------------------------------------------
  
  - Use OR instead of AND for simultaneous album/track title searches:
    if UNchecked, simultaneous album/track title searches behave as all others, i.e. the file needs to meet both search criteria.
  - Ignore upper/lower case when searching text fields:
    if UNchecked, the lower/upper letter case is considered ("love" does not find "Love")
  - Use file creation date instead of file modification date:
    if checked, search is done using the file creation (instead of its modification) date
  - Display file information instead of MP3 tags:
    if checked, search results include the file name, size and date (instead of artist, album, track, genre and album year)
  - Display full path name of MP3 files found (only applicable for "Display file information instead of MP3 tags"):
    if UNchecked, the simple file name is displayed instead of the full file name ("mymp3" instead of "C:\Users\Username\Music\mymp3.mp3")
  - Exclude non-ID3 main genres from selection list:
    if checked, main music genres that are not part of the genres defined in ID3 (identified by "(M)") are not shown in the genres selection list
  - Exclude personal genres from selection list:
    if checked, (my) personal genres (identified by "(-)") are not shown in the genres selection list
	
Search results display window.
==============================

 The files found by the actual search are displayed as a list. What exactly is displayed depends on the selections done in the "Options" menu in
 the main window. If the search was based on the MP3 tags (default), the list is sorted by artist name, album name and track number; if it was
 based on file properties and the full path name is selected to be displayed (default), the list entries are sorted by subdirectory and file name;
 if the full path isn't displayed sorting is done by the simple filename. In this window, you may:
 
 a. To save the search result (just as it is displayed) as a text file, push the "Save info" button.
 b. To open the file location (the containing directory) in Windows explorer, push the "Open directory"  button.
 c. To play the MP3 file (using your default audio player), push the "Play file" button.
 
 Note that for actons 2 and 3 you have to choose a file first. Just use your mouse and select a line in the search results list (the same way you
 do in order to select text in your word processing application).
 
Using your own music genres selection list.
===========================================

 You may fill the genres selection combobox with your favorite music genres by editing the genres.txt file (using a text editor such as Notepad).
 Delete the entries you don't not need and add the genres you want (one genre name per line). The file genres.txt.bak is a backup copy of the
 original genres.tx files.
