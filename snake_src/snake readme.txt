snake 1.0 ReadMe.
=================

This program is obsolete! Use The Snake2 GUI application instead...

Windows 10 note.
----------------

As the Windows 10 Command Prompt is not fixed size but fully resizable as any other
program window, the snake game window is only partially displayed when the program
starts and the window has to be manually resized. To avoid doing this at each program
execution:
 1. create a shortcut of the program
 2. right-click the shortcut and choose "Properties"
 3. in the "Layout" tab, change "Window Size" : set "Width" = 80, "Height" = "50"
 4. apply changes
 5. use the shortcut (instaed of the program itself) to start the game
