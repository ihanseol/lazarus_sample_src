For explanations of the mathematical background of fractals in general, the Mandelbrot set and the
Burning Ship fractal, please, search the Internet. The Burning Ship fractal is generated by iterating
the function z(n+1) = (|Re(z(n))| + i|Im(z(n))|)^2 + c, z0 = 0 in the complex plane, the set of points
either escaping or remaining bounded. This function is similar to the one used to calculate the
andelbrot set; the difference is that the real and imaginary components are set to their respective
absolute values before squaring at each iteration. Using different colors for different number of
iterations produces colorful pictures, looking like ships. The most interresting region to look at,
is a zoom at the lower left region of the fractal.

General notes:
--------------

  1. The program runs in 2 windows, the first for data entry, the second to display the graphical
     representation of the Julia set. After the set has been displayed, you have to close the
     graphics window (using the 'X' at its top right corner) before proceeding.

  2. The format of the number values entered depends on your operating system's regional settings:
     whereas in USA you use a dot (.) as decimal separator, in Europe it's normally a comma (,) that
     separates the integer and fractional parts of a decimal number.

Data entry:
-----------

  1. The starting X- and Y-value within the Burning Ship fractal scale.
     The Burning Ship fractal scale X- and Y-values used in the bship program (modification of the "real" 
	 values for dispay reasons) are from -2.0 to 1.0 for X and from -1.5 to 1.5 for Y. Thus, entering
	 X = -2.0, Y = -1.5 starts the graphical display at the beginning of the set and with zoom factor = 1
	 displays the entire set at the center of the screen. Using X-values > -2.0 is moving the starting
	 X-value to the right, what has the effect to "shift" the graphics leftwards; using Y-values > -1.5 is
	 moving the starting Y-value to the bottom, what has the effect to "shift" the graphics upwards.
	 Modifying the zoom factor at the same time, you will display different regions of the set with
	 different magnitudes, producing lots of different pictures..

  2. The zoom factor.
     It allows to magnify (= to zoom into) the displayed region. Together with the starting X- and Y-value,
	 it determines what the picture displayed will look like.
	 
  3. The option not to display iterations <= 16. This will have for effect not to display the colored "rings"
     (but using the background color instead) around the set. This allows to emphasize the shape of the ship.

Examples:
---------

  1. X=-2.0, Y=-1.5, zoom=1, with rings (default values): entire set at screen center
	 
  2. X=-1.55, Y=-1.3, zoom=1.5, without rings: major region of the set (no "rings")

  3. X=-1, Y=-0.95, zoom=10: zoom into the multi-color region above the set 
  
  4. Some zooms into the lower left region of the fractal. It's here you'll find the ship shapes:
      
	 4a. X=-1.8, Y=-0,15, zoom=12.3
	 4b. X=-1.8, Y=-0.085, zoom=30, 
	 4c. X=-1.655, Y=-0.067, zoom=55. 
   
  5. Just try it out... And enjoy!
