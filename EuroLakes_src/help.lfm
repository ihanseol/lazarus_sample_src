      ''
      'The data, used by "EuroLakes"  is taken from the Wikipedia article "List of largest lakes of Europe"; Internet address = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_lakes_of_Europe. In particular, the lake region (except for Russia, added by myself) is the part of Europe stated in that list (e.g. Romania = East, Albania = South). For lakes, that are partially in Russia, partially in East Europe, both regions are accepted by the application.'
      'To avoid the selection of the bad surface area interval for lakes with an area equal to some interval limits, please, note that "between minimum_area and maximum_area" is considered by the application as "minimum ≤ area < maximum".'
