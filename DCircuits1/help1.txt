Ohm's Law:
==========

The amount of electric current through a resistance in a circuit is directly proportional to the voltage impressed across it (for any given temperature):
  U = I·R.

Series circuits:
================

The total resistance is equal to the sum of the individual resistances:
  R = R1 + R2 + ...

The current is shared equally by all components:
  I = I1 = I2 = ...

The voltage drop across each resistor may be determined by Ohm’s Law:
  U1 = I·R1, U2 = I·R2, ...
and the total voltage equals the sum of the individual voltages:
  U = U1 + U2 + ...

Parallel circuits:
==================

The inverse of the total resistance is equal to the sum of the inverse of the individual resistances:
  1/R = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + ...
This also means that the total resistence is always smaller than the smallest individual resistance and in the case of 2 equal resistances, the total resistance is equal half the individual resistance value.

The voltage is equal across all components in the circuit:
  U = U1 = U2 = ...

The individual resistor ("branch") currents may be determined by Ohm’s Law:
  I1 = U/R1, I2 = U/R2, ...
and the total current is equal the sum of all individual branch currents:
  I = I1 + I2 + ...
