      '"AcidBase" is a chemistry trainer (exercise generator), dealing with acid-base reactions. In the actual version 1.0, only mineral acids and bases are considered.'
      ''
      'Exercises include knowing the acid and the base and finding the salt, as well as knowing the salt and finding the acid and the base. The student is asked for the (not given) molecule formula(s), the ionic composition of reactants and products, the (molecular) equation of the reaction (balanced, of course) and (optionally) the involved molecules'' names. Also optionally, the application can generate questions with the acid/base resp. salt names given instead of their formaulas.'
