      '"Geography1" is a quiz application, dealing with the longest rivers of the world. The quiz includes 7 kinds of questions:'
      ''
      '  - Longest rivers: **not implemented in version 1.0**'
      '  - River length: Find the length of a given river (interval list selection).'
      '  - Drainage area: Find the drainage area for a given river (interval list selection).'
      '  - Average discharge: Find the average discharge for a given river (interval list selection).'
      '  - River outflow: Find the outflow river/sea for a given river (list selection or manual entry).'
      '  - Continent: Find the continent for a given river (list selection).'
      '  - Drainage countries: Find the countries, that are part of the drainage basin of a given river.'
      '    The application shows 5 countries and the user has to check those, that belong to the drainage basin.'
      '    Please, note that any number of the countries listed (incl. all and none) may be the correct answer.'
      ''
      'Beside the kind of quiz questions, the user has the possibility to choose, what rivers are included in the quiz questions list, by limiting the rivers asked to the 25, 50 or 100 longest ones or limiting them to the longest ones on a given continent.'
      ''
      'To do the quiz, choose the quiz options and choose one of the items in the "Quiz" menu to start a new quiz (of one of the kinds available). Note, that the options may not be changed during the quiz. Thus, if you leave a quiz, without having done all questions, the menu "Options" will be disabled. If you want to change the quiz options, you''ll have first to select an item in the "Quiz" menu. For some options, you may have to redo this selection, after you''ve changed the settings. The quiz is started with the "Start" button. Push "Question" to generate a new question, "Answer" to make the application check your answer.'

      'Choose the number of quiz questions (minimum 10). If this number exceeds the number of rivers available for a given list selection, it is automatically set to the maximum of rivers in the list (e.g. 22 for European rivers). As data for the drainage area and the discharge is incomplete, the number of list entries (and thus the number of possible questions) may be further reduced for these quizes (e.g. for African rivers: 11 drainage area and only 8 discharge questions). Note, that this setting only becomes active, after a new quiz has been selected in the "Quiz" menu.'

      'Outflow entry.'
      '--------------'
      'Choose, how you want to enter the river''s outflow. Options available:'
      '  - Manual entry:'
      '    You have to enter the outflow river/sea manually. This implies higher Geography knowledge,'
      '    but also possible mistakes, due to the misspelling of a noun. There are no buttons for non-English'
      '    characters (as you find in several applications on my site). Just use the "corresponding" English'
      '    letter (e.g. "a" for "á", "ue" for "ü", "n" for "ñ"); the program counts such answers as correct (and'
      '    indicates the correct spelling in the evaluation field).'
      '  - Selection list:'
      '    You may choose the outflow from a list with 10 entries. The list is redone for each question and,'

      'All data, used by the "Geography1" application is taken from the Wikipedia article "List of rivers by length" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rivers_by_length). However, some rivers haven''t been included, because their name is not unique, because they have drainage countries on two continents, etc.'
      ''
      'For river legths, where Wikipedia lists two values, the first one is used. The continent, as the other data, is the one stated in the Wikipedia list, thus Russia will appear belonging to Europe for some rivers and to Asia for others. Also, be aware that a river, draining a given country, not necessarily flows across this country (e.g. Luxembourg is rather far away from the Rhine).'

      '  - A drainage countries quiz with Australian rivers isn''t useful, as the answer is always "Australia".'
      '  - The drainage countries quiz with North American rivers isn''t really senseful, either, because the'
