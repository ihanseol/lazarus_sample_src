===================

The numeric system represented by Roman numerals originated in ancient Rome and remained the usual way of writing numbers throughout Europe well into the Late Middle Ages. Numbers in this system are represented by combinations of letters from the Latin alphabet.

Roman numerals, as used today, employ seven symbols, each with a fixed integer value, as follows:

  Symbol    I    V     X     L     C      D       M
  ---------------------------------------------------
  Value     1    5    10    50    100    500    1,000
  
The original pattern for Roman numerals used the symbols I, V, and X (1, 5, and 10) as simple tally marks. Each marker for 1 (I) added a unit value up to 5 (V), and was then added to (V) to make the numbers from 6 to 9:

  I, II, III, IIII, V, VI, VII, VIII, VIIII, X.

The numerals for 4 (IIII) and 9 (VIIII) proved problematic (among other things, they are easily confused with III and VIII, especially at a quick glance), and are generally replaced with IV (one less than 5) and IX (one less than 10). This feature of Roman numerals is called subtractive notation.

The numbers from 1 to 10 (including subtractive notation for 4 and 9) are expressed in Roman numerals as follows:

  I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X.
  
The system being basically decimal, tens and hundreds follow the same underlying pattern. This is the key to understanding Roman numerals.

Thus 10 to 100 (counting in tens, with X taking the place of I, L taking the place of V and C taking the place of X):

  X, XX, XXX, XL, L, LX, LXX, LXXX, XC, C.

Note that 40 (XL) and 90 (XC) follow the same subtractive pattern as 4 and 9, avoiding the confusing XXXX.

Similarly, 100 to 1000 (counting in hundreds):

  C, CC, CCC, CD, D, DC, DCC, DCCC, CM, M.

Again - 400 (CD) and 900 (CM) follow the standard subtractive pattern, avoiding CCCC.

In the absence of standard symbols for 5,000 and 10,000 the pattern breaks down at this point - in modern usage M is repeated up to three times. The Romans had several ways to indicate larger numbers, but for practical purposes Roman numerals for numbers larger than 3,999 are seldom if ever used nowadays, and this suffices.

  M, MM, MMM.
