    <span style="font-style: italic">Kidspuzzle</span> is a classic puzzle game for PC: Try to order the puzzle pieces in order to recreate the puzzle picture, in a similar
    way as you would do with a "real" puzzle. The application is intended to be for children: puzzle pictures are motifs of the kids-world and the number of puzzle pieces is
    kept small, for several of the available puzzles even very small, so that the program can even be useful to the youngest ones.

    system and selecting the file, containing the puzzle state information. Unless you chose another one, these files have the extension .kps. If the state file is deleted or
    not, depends on the settings made in the <span style="font-weight: bold">Options</span> menu.

    style="font-style: italic">Kidspuzzle</span> download directory</span></a> on www.streetinfo.lu. The puzzles are stored as ZIP archives, containing the configuration
    file and the puzzle piece pictures. All files start with Pnnn, where nnn indicates the number of pieces. P016 - Merry Xmas_3.0.7 contains the 16-pieces <span style="font-style:
    italic">Merry Xmas</span> puzzle, included within the version 4.0 application download archive. All files end with a version number of the form m.s.u. Please, have a look at
    <a href="#version"><span style="color: #0000FF">Version compatibility</span></a> below for details.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify">
    Choose a puzzle and download the .zip file on your hard drive. Extract the puzzle folder with its content to any location, you like. If you now run the <span
    style="font-style: italic">Kidspuzzle</span> application, choose <span style="font-weight: bold">New</span> in the <span style="font-weight: bold">Puzzle</span> menu and
    select the folder, that you extracted, in the dialog box. The newly downloaded puzzle should be loaded correctly. The .zip file itself is no longer needed and may be deleted.

    The selections, that you make in this menu, are written to the file kidspuzzle.conf, that is read at application start. Thus, your actual settings will be used, the next
    time, you run the program.

  <p style="text-align: justify">
    Select, what the application should do, if the filename, you specify in the <span style="font-weight: bold">Save As</span> dialog box, already exists: 1. Ask before
    overriding a file (default option, with you to decide to override the file or not), 2. Override files without asking (this may delete a puzzle state file, that you
    wanted to keep), 3. Never override state files (the file can't be saved with this name and you have to repeat the operation).
  </p>
  <p style="padding-top:5px; text-decoration:underline">
    State files deletion.

  <p style="text-align: justify">
    Select, what the application should do with a state file, after you opened it, in order to restore a previously saved puzzle (<span style="font-weight: bold">Open</span>
    dialog box): 1. Ask before deleting a file (may be useful to prevent deleting a file without wanting to do so, for example, if you select the bad file), 2. Automatically
    delete files (default option, as normally these files are no longer useful), 3. Never delete state files (all files are kept; you'll have to delete them manually).

    <a name="run">Doing the puzzle.</a>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify">
    Load a fresh puzzle with <span style="font-weight: bold">New</span> in the <span style="font-weight: bold">Puzzle</span> menu. The puzzle picture is displayed, all pieces
    in the correct order. To begin, push the <span style="font-weight: bold">Start</span> button: The puzzle pieces are now shuffled and appear at random positions within the
    picture. To move a given piece to a given position (the one, you think, is the correct one): 1. Click this piece with your mouse. A colored circle appears on the clicked
    piece, telling you, that it is actually selected for moving (to unselect a selected piece, just click it again). 2. Click the piece at the position, where you want to move
    the selected piece. The two pieces' positions are exchanged: the piece, that you selected to be moved, is placed at the position of your second click, and the piece, that
    was at that position, replaces the one, you clicked first (the one that you chose to move).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify">
    The movement of the second piece is the major difference between playing <span style="font-style: italic">Kidspuzzle</span> and doing a "real puzzle", with "real pieces"
    on a table. If you're irritated by that, tell yourself, that this second piece is of no importance at this moment. The only thing, you have to consider to solve the puzzle,
    is choosing a piece and moving it to the position, that you think, it belongs to. Isn't that what you actually do, when you do a "real puzzle"?
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify">
    The (final) puzzle picture is displayed at the top right corner of the application window, so you can see there, how the completed puzzle should look like. With bigger
    puzzles, this picture is unfortunately rather small. But, there's another way to have a look at the (final) puzzle picture: Push the <span style="font-weight:
    bold">Show</span> button to display all puzzle pieces at their correct position; to continue doing the puzzle, push <span style="font-weight: bold">Restore</span>.
  </p>
  <p style="padding-top:10px; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline">
    <a name="version">Version compatibility.</a>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify">
    The names of the puzzle download files on www.streetinfo.lu end with a puzzle file version number of the form m.s.u, where m and s are the main- and sub-version number and
    u is an update-number, that has no other function than "grouping" all puzzles of a given version, that have been created/published together at a given date. The m.s part of
    the puzzle version number corresponds to the m.s version number of the application itself. Thus, all puzzles v4.0.x have been created with the release of <span
    style="font-style: italic">Kidspuzzle v4.0</span> (the one, that you're actually using).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify">
    It is important to have a closer look at the main-version number of puzzle files, that you want to download. In fact, <span style="color: #FF0000">puzzle files, that have
    a main version number, that is higher than the main version number of the application, will not work with that application</span> and when you try to load them, you'll get
    an error message. On the other side, <span style="font-style: italic">Kidspuzzle</span> is backward compatible and program modifications, with publishing of an updated
    application with a new (higher) sub-version number, do not affect the puzzle files. Thus, with your actual <span style="font-style: italic">Kidspuzzle v4.0</span>, you can
    use puzzle files with version 4.0 of course, but also any versions 1.s.u, 2.s.u and 3.s.u. And, if I published a new 4.1 version, also the corresponding puzzles 4.1.u.
    However, if one day you find puzzle files 5.s.u on the download page, they will not work with your actual application and if you want to use them, you'll have to download
    <span style="font-style: italic">Kidspuzzle v5.0</span> or higher</span> (if some day they exist).
