    The Marienbad game is a variant of the classic Nim game and the application <span style="font-style: italic">Marienbad</span> is a free implementation of this game for PC.
    The rules of Marienbad are as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>16 matches are placed in 4 rows (on 4 heaps), the number of matches per row being respectively: 1, 3, 5, 7.</li>
      <li>The two players alternately remove one or more matches.</li>
      <li>Matches may only be removed from a single row.</li>
      <li>It is up to the player to decide how many matches they take: at least one, at most all (the whole row).</li>
      <li>In one of the versions of the game (called <span style="font-style: italic">Nim</span> variant in the application), the player, who takes the last match, wins.</li>
      <li>In another version of the game (called <span style="font-style: italic">Misere</span> variant in the application), the player, who takes the last match, looses.</li>
    </ul>

    Select, what happens if you remove a match. If <span style="font-style: italic">Remove</span> is selected, the match is effectively removed; using this option makes the

    but is stroked through to mark that it has been removed; using this option, makes it easier to mentally calculate the Nim sums in order to determine the winning move. But,
    it has another advantage, offering an <span style="font-weight: bold">Undo functionality</span> (cf. <a href="#run"><span style="color: blue; text-decoration:

    The Nim game in general and the Marienbad game in particular are games where one of the players, when playing without making any mistake, always wins (thus, the other one
    always looses). For both variants of Marienbad, <span style="font-weight: bold">the player, who starts the game, will always loose, if the other player makes the optimal
    moves</span>. Marienbad may be mathematically solved and so it is possible to write a winning algorithm, that allows the computer to win all games, where the player makes
    the first move. To give the player a possibility to win such games, the program must support several game levels, where the computer plays with different strength. Except
    for the full strength level, the program more or less often makes a mistake, by making a <span style="font-weight: bold">random move</span> instead of making the one, that
    would win the game.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify">
    The <span style="font-style: italic">Marienbad</span> PC application allows to make the computer play with one of three different strengths:
    <ul>
      <li style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-weight: bold">Expert</span>: The computer plays at full strength (following the winning algorithm for all moves). Thus,
      if the player starts the game, they always loose; if the computer starts the game, the player wins if they play without mistake, but making one single mistake, the computer
      will win the game.</li>
      <li style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-weight: bold">Beginner</span>: This level, intended for people that never played Nim before or for young children, is
      somewhat the contrary of  <span style="font-style: italic">Expert</span>: The program makes random moves during the entire game and the player has all chances to win. Not
      entirely true: If there is one single row of matches left and the number of matches is such that the program will win when making the correct move, it will make it.</li>
      <li style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-weight: bold">Intermediate</span>: Strong players would probably prefer to play the game with the computer beginning the
      game and playing at full strength, giving them the possibility to always win, but only if they play without making any mistake. Less strong players should select the <span
      style="font-style: italic">Intermediate</span> computer strength. Except, towards the end of the game, the program makes at a ca 50% ratio a random move (and, if there
      actually is one, the winning move for the other 50%). When there are only two rows of matches left or when all rows contain exactly one match, the program doesn't make
      random moves anymore, i.e. plays at the full strength.</li>
    </ul>

    For any suggestions or comments, please send me an <a href="mailto:info@streetinfo.lu"><span style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline">email</span></a>. This is in
    particular true, if you should win a game in the case where the program plays with <span style="font-style: italic">Expert</span> strength and you made the first move. This
    should not be possible and if it nevertheless happened, it would mean that there is a bug in my winning algorithm.
