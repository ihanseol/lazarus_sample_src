These are the program samples of the tutorial "Using InterBase databases with Lazarus/Free Pascal" at
  https://www.streetinfo.lu/computing/lazarus/project/use_interbase.html

IbSQL:  Connection to an InterBase database using TIbConnection. To use this application, you'll have to copy ibclient64.dll
        (from the "bin" folder of the InterBase installation directory) to your project folder, and rename it to "fbclient.dll"
IbSQL2: Connection to an InterBase database using TODBCConnection. To use this application, you'll have to create a User DSN,
        as described in the tutorial https://www.streetinfo.lu/computing/programming/windows/software/win_ibase.html
