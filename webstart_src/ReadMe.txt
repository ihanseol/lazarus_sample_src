webstart.exe v1.0.
==================

Command line utility, that copies the CGI or PHP script, given as argument, from the Windows filesystem
(e.g. development library) to the webserver filesystem and then launches the webbrowser, pointed to the
corresponding URL.

All parameters, other than the source file path, are read from the configuration file webstart.conf.

I wrote this program to be used as command within the Komodo Edit toolbox: copy of the currently edited
.pl, .pm or .php file to the Apache filesystem and launch the script in the browser.
