"dwnldcount" is a VERY SIMPLE command line program, that may be used to count the downloads from a website. Counting is done on a monthly base
for the current year and considering given types of files (files with a given extension), downloaded from a given webserver directory (URL).
Which directories with which files to consider is defined in the configuration file dwnldcount.ini. The number of download counts to do
(= number of [downloadsN] sections in the .INI file) is defined by the value of the stats_download_counts key in the [stats] section.

Each of these download counts has its own section in the .INI file; keys are the following:
 - files_description = description, what data the files contain (e.g. my homeless people PDF articles);
 - files_url = the server directory, where the files are located (expressed as relative URL; thus, must begin with a slash; e.g. /sdf/articles/);
 - files_ext = extension of the files to be considered for counting in this directory (must begin with a dot; e.g. .pdf);
 - files_server = number of the considered files actually available in the considered directory (not really useful, as varies from month to month;
   may be left blank); the value of this key is supposed to be the total number of files actually on the server;
 - files_exclude = files not to be considered in counting (e.g. article00, this PDF not being an article, but a list of all articles). To specify
   several files to be excluded, use a semicolon as separation character.

The input for the program is taken from text files, one for each month, and containing the statistics of file downloads from your webserver.
Location, name (and extension) of these statistics files are defined in the [stats] section of the .INI file. The file names have mandatorily to
end with a date, with the format "YYMM" or "YYYYMM". Countings are done from January to the month preceding the current one. If there is no file
found for some month, the corresponding counts in the program output will be 0.

The input text files must have a given format: each line has to contain:
 - a relative file URI (thus, begin with a slash);
 - one or more spaces (or a tab character, replaced by a space by the program)
 - the number of (monthly) downloads for this file;
 - the line may contain further data, separated from the download number by a space (or tab).

You may create these input files manually or writing a program to do it. I myself create them by hand, based on the output of the statistics web
application awstats (available on the webserver of most webspace hosting providers): Just displaying the statistics for the different months,
clicking the "Downloads > Full list" link and then copy/paste the list data into a text file.

The program output with the monthly download counts is a text file called downloadsYYYY.txt. For each of the download counts to be done, there are
two lines:
 - the first one shows the monthly download of different files, i.e. how many of the considered files actually present in the considered directory
   have been downloaed during a given month; e.g. 139 Free Pascal sources of the 144 available;
 - the second one shows the total monthly file download, i.e. how may times the considered files in the considered directory have been downloaded
   during a given month (resp. last column: during the actual year so far); e.g. 533 times that a Free Pascal source has been downloaded.

Please, note that the .INI file included in the download archive is the one, I actually use with my website and, of course, has to be modified by
setting the different keys to your own values. The downloads2020.txt file is the output, I got in December 2020. It's just included as example, to
show, what the program output looks like.
