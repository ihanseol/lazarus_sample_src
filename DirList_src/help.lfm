      '"DirList" is an application, that may be used to create the listing of a folder''s files and subfolders on a Microsoft Windows computer. The listing is similar to what you get in File Explorer, the major difference being the possibility to separate the system objects from the other ones and the display of the file attributes. The list may be exported to a file, with text, CSV or HTML format.'
