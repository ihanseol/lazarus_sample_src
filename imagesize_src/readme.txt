This archive contains the sample programs of the tutorial "Determination of the width and height of an image from file" at
  http://www.streetinfo.lu/computing/lazarus/programming/imgsize.html

There are three Lazarus command line projects:
 - imgsize:  determination of the image size of BMP, GIF, JPEG, PNG, PCX files using FCL-Image;
 - imgsize2: determination of the image size of BMP, GIF, JPEG, PNG files using the "picslib" unit;
 - pngsize:  determination of the image size of PNG files by directly reading the binary file.

Please, note that the "picslib" files are NOT included in the archive. You can download them from
  https://svn.code.sf.net/p/flyingsheep/code/trunk/MijnLib/ (cf. the tutorial for details).
