TestMSSQL ReadMe.
=================

This simple Lazarus/Free Pascal application is a code sample, used in the tutorial "Using Microsoft SQL Server databases with Lazarus/Free Pascal"
at https://www.streetinfo.lu/computing/lazarus/project/use_mssql.html. The download archive only contains the Lazarus project files, thus, you'll
have yourself to 1. download and create the BikeStores database, 2. download the client libraries dblib.dll and libiconv.dll, and place them in
your project's output directory. Please, have a look at the tutorial webpage for details.
