      '"Converter2" is a maths exercise generator, dealing with measurement unit conversions. It is intended for American and British primary school pupils, thus the exercises are focused on these measurement systems and exercises with international units are limited (for such exercises, you may prefer to use my "Converter" application). The kind of exercises may be chosen in the "Test" menu:'
      ''
      'American system:'
      '----------------'
      'Conversion of American length, area, volume, fluid capacity, dry capacity and (avdp) weight to units of the same system.'
      ''
      'British system:'
      '---------------'
      'Conversion of British length, area, volume, (fluid and dry) capacity and (avdp) weight to units of the same system.'
      ''
      'International/US:'
      '-----------------'
      'Conversion of American length, area, volume, fluid capacity, dry capacity and (avdp) weight to "one corresponding" international unit (ex: miles to km, pounds to kg) and vice-versa.'
      ''
      'International/UK:'
      '-----------------'
      'Conversion of British length, area, volume, (fluid and dry) capacity and (avdp) weight to "one corresponding" international unit.'
      ''
      'Use the "Settings" menu to choose, if the units have to be shown as symbols or as their full names.'
      ''
      'To start a test, select a measurement and then, choose one of the 4 items in the "Test" menu. You''ll always have to start a new test, after you changed the measurement (a message will remember you, if you didn''t). You also get an error message, if the measurement selected does not exist as such for the system chosen (e.g. capacity for US system). And finally, note that changing the number of questions only takes effect, when a new test has been started. To do the test, alternately push "Question" to generate the exercise and "Answer" to have your answer checked.'

      'Exercise evaluation.'
      '===================='
      ''
      'The problem with this kind of exercises is to evaluate a correct answer as correct. What I mean is, that not only the conversion result depends on the number of decimal digits considered, but also on the conversion factor used. If, for example, you convert miles to km, considering that 1 mi = ‪1,609344‬ (as does MS Windows Calculator application), you get a result, that significantly differs with the one expected by "Converter2", that considers that 1 mi = 1,609 km. To avoid, that your correct answer is evaluated as false by the application, please use the conversion factore as given on the website of Encyclopædia Britannica.
