Use "Example" in the "Test" menu to let you show, how the table should look like. If you want, you may use the cream colored fields to remember the carry of the partial multiplications and/or the final addition (use the "Clear" button to empty all carry fields).'

The evaluation counters (with success expressed as percentage) are updated accordingly. Please note, that in the current version 1.0, the application only checks the final result without considering what you entered in the partial multiplication fields.'
