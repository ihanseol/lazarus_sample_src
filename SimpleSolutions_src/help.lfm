      '"SimpleSolutions" is a chemistry application that may be used to calculate the concentration of aqueous and other solutions. The solute quantity may be given as molarity, as mole quantity, as mass or as volume (in this latter case, the solute density must also be given). The application calculates the solute and solvent molecular weight, mole quantity and mole fraction. The solution concentration is shown in g/L, as molarity and molality, and (for acids and bases) as normality. The application also calculates several percentage values for the solute. Please, note that the program does not do a validation of user input data. It does neither check if the solute entered is effectively soluble, nor considers the maximum of solute that may actually be dissolved in the solvent volume specified. Thus, if you enter senseless data, as a solution of AgCl (silver compounds aren''t soluble) or a solution of 2kg of NaCl in 100ml of water, the calculation results will be just as senseless.'

      'The solute quantity may be entered as molarity (number of moles in a solution volume of 1L), as mol quantity (moles or millimoles in the actual solution volume), as mass (mg, g, or kg), or as volume (ml, cl, dl, L). In this latter case, it is mandatory to enter a solute density. The characteristic of the solute allows to distinguish mineral acids and bases and organic acids from "ordinary" substances. The only difference that the choice makes, is that for the "special" substances mentioned, the normality is calculated. Calculated, if the application recognizes the acid or base chemical group within the molecule. Formulas must have the following format:'
      '  - mineral acids: must start with H or Hi (where i is an integer).'
      '  - mineral bases: must end with OH or (OH)i.'
      '  - organic acids: must end with COOH, or (COOH)i;'
      '                   there may also be a carboxyl group (in inverse order) at the left end of the molecule; ex: HOOCCOOH.'
