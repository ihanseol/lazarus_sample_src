"EngVerbs" is an educational application, dealing with English grammar: It generates several kinds of exercises concerning the base forms (infinitive, simple past and past participle) of English verbs and may in particular be used to test the knowledge of irregular verbs.

Choose the type of exercise you want in the "Test" menu, push "Start" to begin, then alternately use the "Question" and "Answer" ("Correct"/"False") buttons to generate a new question and to check the answer, you entered.

Menu "Test".
============

Regular/irregular test.
-----------------------
From a list of verbs, choose those, that are regular resp. irregular. Choosing this type of exercises opens a new window with 2 boxes: The left one contains the verb list generated by the program; the right one has to contain the verbs that satisfy the regular/irregular condition, you chose. To move a verb into the answer box, click it and push the "-->" button; if you made a mistake, use "<--" to remove the verb from the answer box. There are English verbs that have both a regular and an irregular form. If these verbs have or haven't to be included as answers depends upon the status of the corresponding checkbox. If the answer box contains all and only those verbs that it should, your answer is considered as correct. If there is an error, the erroneous verb is displayed in uppercase. An uppercase verb in the left box means that you should have moved it because it'a part of the answer; an uppercase verb in the right box means that you moved a verb, that isn't part of the answer. Note that the evaluation counters are updated (as for the other exercise types) in the main window.

Tenses yes/no test.
-------------------
The application displays all 3 tenses of the verb and you have to decide if all is correct or not. In this type of exercises, the "Answer" button is replaced by a "Correct" and a "False" button, that allow you to directly enter your yes/no choice. Note, that after entering your answer, the color of the simple past or past participle field may change to yellow: This indicates that the conjugated form displayed actually is a mistake (and you had to use the "False" button to give the correct answer).

Tenses conjugation test.
------------------------
For the infinitive of the verb displayed, enter its simple past and past participle. For verbs with several conjugated forms, you may choose the one you want. For the verbs, that haven't a past participle, just leave the field empty.  You may limit the test to irregular verbs only by checking the corresponding checkbox. A field in red indicates a wrong answer. This is the default exercise type (application start-up).

Tenses alternate forms test.
----------------------------
This test concerns only those verbs, that have several conjugations for the simple past and/or the past participle. The exercises are similar to the ones before, but you have to enter all conjugated forms of the past and participle. A field in red indicates a wrong answer; a magenta colored field indicates that you entered the correct conjugation twice, instead of entering the 2 different conjugated forms available.
