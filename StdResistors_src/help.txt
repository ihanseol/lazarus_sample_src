StdResistors is a FreePascal application that may be used to determine standard resistors. The program offers 2 options:

1. Finding the standard resistor nearest to a resistance value entered by the user. In this case, enter the resistance, choose a unit (and if you want a tolerance value) and push the "Go!" button. The program determines the nearest standard resistor and displays it with the corresponding band colors.

2. Determining the resistance value for a resistor identified by its band colors. In this case, click the color shapes to enter the band colors. When you push the "Go!" button, the program displas information about the band colors you entered and the resistance value.

The meaning of standard resistors' bands is as follows:

1. band = first digit of resistance value
2. band = second digit of resistance value
3. band = multiplier as a number of zeros (except when it’s gold or silver).
4. band = resistance value tolerance (if omitted, a tolerance of 20% is supposed).

Resistor Colour Coding:

Colour     1st/2nd band     3rd band     4th band
-------------------------------------------------
Black           0            x 1           ±20%
Brown           1            x 10           ±1%
Red             2            x 100          ±2%
Orange          3            x 1000         ±3%
Yellow          4            x 1e+4         ±4%
Green           5            x 1e+5         n/a
Blue            6            x 1e+6         n/a
Violet          7            x 1e+7         n/a
Gray            8            x 1e+8         n/a
White           9            x 1e+9         n/a
Gold           n/a           x 0.1          ±5%
Silver         n/a           x 0.01        ±10%

Example:
 black-brown-blue-silver: 01 x 1e+6 = 10.000.000Ω = 1MΩ with a tolerance of 10%.

Standard resistor values:
 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 43, 47, 51, 56, 62, 68, 75, 82, 91
 
Thus if you search for a standard resistor with approximate resistance of 3.5kΩ, the program resturns a value of 3.6kΩ (orange-blue-red).
