    <span style="font-style:italic">TimerCircuits555</span> is a simple electronics application that simulates bistable, monostable and astable circuits implemented with a
    555 timer IC (e.g. NE555). The following help text only concerns the usage of the application. For details concerning the 555 timer and the circuits simulated by the program,
    please, search the Internet or have a look at an electronics book. The <a href="http://www.kpsec.freeuk.com/555timer.htm" target="_blank"><span style="color:blue">555 and
    556 Timer Circuits</span></a> page at the website of <span style="font-style:italic">The Electronics Club</span>, for example, contains all information, that you need, to
    understand how the IC and the circuits work and how the time period (monostable) and mark and space time (astable) are calculated.

    The output of a standard 555 timer can <span style="font-weight:bold">sink and source</span> up to 200mA. This is sufficient to supply many output transducers directly,
    in particular LEDs (with a resistor in series). The options of this menu item allow you to choose if you want to connect the LED to +V<sub>s</sub> (LED on if output is low)
    or to 0V (LED on if output is high), or using 2 LEDs (getting a blinker circuit in the case of the astable). Note that in the circuit display, a colored circle is used to
    represent the LED plus its resistor.

    Bistable circuits.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">
    Bistable circuits (flip-flops) are <span style="font-weight:bold">memory circuits with two stable states</span>. Pushing the <span style="font-style:italic">SET</span>
    switch, the output of the flip-flop becomes high and LED<sub>2</sub> (LED connected between pin 3 of the 555 and 0V) goes on; the output remains in this state, even if
    you release the switch. With the <span style="font-style:italic">RESET</span> switch, the output of the flip-flop becomes low and LED<sub>2</sub> goes out; the circuit
    remains in this state after the switch has been released.
  </p>
  <p style="padding-top:5px; text-decoration:underline">
    Monostable circuits.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">
    Monostable circuits have only <span style="font-weight:bold">one stable state</span> (default state, normally the one where the circuit output is low). The <span
    style="font-weight:bold">other state is unstable, i.e. after a given time (called the time period) it automatically switches back</span> to the stable state. The time period
    depends on the time it takes to load the capacitor at a given charge, thus depends on the capacitance and the charging resistance. You can either enter a resistance value
    and calculate the corresponding time period or calculate the resistance that you must use to hold the circuit for a given time in the unstable state (depending on the
    selection done in the <span style="font-style:italic">Options</span> menu). Enter the circuit values and push the <span style="font-style:italic">Calculate</span> button.
    Then push the <span style="font-style:italic">SET</span> switch. The output of the circuit becomes high (LED<sub>2</sub> goes on) and stays high until the time period is
    over. Note, that after the switch has been pushed, this process is started and goes its way; what I mean is that pushing the switch during the unstable state has no
    influence on the behavior of the circuit (duration of the unstable state). The application has however an option to add a <span style="font-style:italic">RESET</span>
    switch to the circuit; pushing it, immediately resets the circuit to its stable state.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">
    The described timer circuits are only functioning correctly with resistance values being in a certain interval (1k立 to 1M立). The application accepts values between
    100立 and 10M立. If you enter values outside this range, you get an error message. This is also true, if you enter a time period that would make necessary a resistance
    outside the range. The application only accepts standard resistor values. Entering a non-standard value results in an error message. If the resistance has to be calculated,
    the given time period is automatically adjusted (display of a warning message, unless warnings are set to be suppressed) to get a resistance with standard value.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">
    It is evident that if the time period is very small, it will not be possible to follow the process and that below a certain value the application will not be fast enough
    to work correctly. The program doesn't check the time period value; when ensuring yourself that its value is greater than 100ms, there shouldn't be a problem.
  </p>
  <p style="padding-top:5px; text-decoration:underline">
    Astable circuits.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">
    Astable circuits have <span style="font-weight:bold">no stable state</span>, what means that they <span style="font-weight:bold">alternate automatically between two
    unstable states, being in an "active" state during a given <span style="font-style:italic">mark time</span> and being in an "inactive" state during a given <span
    style="font-style:italic">space time</span></span> (the <span style="font-style:italic">time period</span> in this case being the sum of the mark time and the space time).
    Mark time and space time depend on the time it takes to charge resp. discharge the capacitor. Thus the mark time depends on the capacitance and the resistances R<sub>1</sub>
    and R<sub>2</sub> and the space time depends on the capacitance and the resistance R<sub>1</sub>. This means that (with the basic implementation of the circuit), the mark
    time is always greater than the space space time and the <span style="font-weight:bold">duty cycle</span> is always greater than 50%. There is however a simple way to
    to be able to get duty cycles less than 50%: Connecting a <span style="font-weight:bold">diode in parallel with R<sub>2</sub></span> (this implementation of the circuit may
    be selected in the <span style="font-style:italic">Options</span> menu), this resistance is bypassed during the capacitor's charge and you can get any duty cycle you want
    (in particular exactly 50% with R<sub>1</sub> = R<sub>2</sub>).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">
    You can either enter the two resistance values and calculate the corresponding mark and space time or calculate the resistances that you must use to get a given mark
    and space time (depending on the selection done in the <span style="font-style:italic">Options</span> menu). Enter the circuit values and push the
    <span style="font-style:italic">Calculate</span> button. Then push <span style="font-style:italic">Start</span> to start the simulation. The output of the circuit
    becomes high (LED<sub>2</sub> on) and stays high during the mark time, then becomes low (LED<sub>2</sub> off) and stays low during the space time. The actual values of
    mark and space time are displayed as the simulation proceeds.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">
    The remarks made for the monostable resistance also apply to the resistances of the astable. Another error message that you may get with this circuit concerns the input
    of time values resulting in a duty cycle greater than 50% with a circuit implementation without diode.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">
    If the time period is very small, it will be impossible to follow the flickering of the LED. And if it is less than a certain value, the application will not be fast
    enough to work correctly. The program doesn't check the mark and space time values; when ensuring yourself that these values are greater than 100ms, there shouldn't be a
    problem.
