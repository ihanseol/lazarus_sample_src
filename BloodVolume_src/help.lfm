      'This application may help to determine the total blood volume (TBV) of a given individual, choosing between 4 different calculation methods.'
      ''
      'The Reference Book method and Gilcher''s Rule by Five estimate the TBV based on an empirical average blood volume value (volume of blood per kg of body weight), depending on the sex and other factors.'
      ''
      'The Reference Book method uses AverageBV values depending on the life period of the individual. These values are as follows:'
      ''
      '  Man:   75 ml/kg     Woman:  65 ml/kg     Boy:     70 ml/kg     Girl:      65 ml/kg'
      '  Child: 75 ml/kg     Infant: 80 ml/kg     Newborn: 85 ml/kg     Premature: 96 ml/kg.'
      ''
      'Gilcher’s Rule of Five (normally used for adults only) takes into account that not all types of tissue contain the same amount of blood. This means that if a person is obese or very thin, this will influence the accuracy of the calculations. Gilcher’s Rule of Fives makes adjustments of the estimated AverageBV, depending on the individual''s appearance. The values used are as follows:'
      ''
      '            Muscular     Normal     Thin     Obese'
      '  Men          75          70        65        60'
      '  Women        70          65        60        55'
      ''
      'With both methods, the TBV (in ml) is then given by: TBV = AverageBV * Weight.'
      ''
      'Nadler uses a different approach: The TBV is calculated using a formula, based on the individual''s body weight (in pounds!) and body height (in inches!). There are different formulas for men and women, calculation being only applicable to adults. TBV will be in ml.'
      ''
      '  Men:   TBV = (0.006012 x Height^3) + (14.6 x Weight) + 604'
      '  Women: TBV = (0.005835 x Height^3) + (15.0 x Weight) + 183'
      ''
      'It has shown, that the most reliable method for TBV determination is the one, based on the Lemmens-Bernstein-Brodsky equation. Similar to the first two methods, TBV is calculated by the product of an average blood volume per kg and the individual''s weight, but the average value isn''t here preset, but calculated, based on the individual''s body mass index (BMI). This largely more realistic average blood volume is called indexed blood volume (InBV). Calculations (for adults of both sexes) are as follows (with weight in kg, height in m and volumes in ml):'
      ''
      '  BMI = Weight / Height²'
      '  InBV = 70 / √(BMI / 22)'
      '  TBV = InBV * Weight'
      ''
      'To use the application, set the weight, height and volume units as you want ("Options" menu), choose a calculation method, select the appropriate individuals group and fill in the parameters needed to do the calculation. When done, push the "Compute" button - TBV (and, if accurate, the AverageBV value used resp. InBV value calculated) will be displayed. Note, that InBV is normally given in ml/kg; to avoid changing this unit, when using weights in pounds and/or volumes in liters, let the "InBV always in ml/kg" option checked.'
