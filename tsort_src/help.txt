Usage:
  TSORT input-file output-file [sort-oder] [COLS:sortcolumns-list] [options]

  input-file        path to the sort input file
  output-file       path to the sort output file; if the path doesn't contain
                    a directory, the input file directory is used; the output
                    file may be identical to the input file if -O is specified
                    (you may use * instead of output-file if you want to
                    override the input file)
  sort-oder         ASC (default) or DESC
  sortcolumns-list  sortcolumns, separated by commas (no spaces allowed)
    sortcolumns     startcolumn and endcolumn, separated by a hyphen
  options           -A   sort characters with accents by character-code
                    -C   consider letter case for sort
                    -D   remove lines with duplicate key values
                    -H:n consider first n lines as header
                    -O   allow overriding an existing output-file
                    -S   consider spaces for sort
