      '"ColorCircles" is a logic game, the aim being to find (by clicking it in the right grid) the one circle, that differs in color when comparing the circles at equivalent positions in the two grids. My program is based on the game "Farbkreise", that I found in Mathematik alpha 2018 (copyright Â© 1985-2018 Steffen Polster). Mathematik alpha is a great collection of maths related programs, aiming to help teachers and students understand and solve scientific problems (maths, physics, simulations, games...). The software (in German) is entirely free and may be downloaded from http://mathematikalpha.de.'

In 2-player mode, the times made by each of them are compared and the one who took the less time will score. If this option is unchecked, scoring is simply done by 1 point for each game won; if it is checked, the player, who won, gets its score increased by a nmber depending on the difference of time the players took to find the circle.'
