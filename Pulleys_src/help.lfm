      '"Pulleys" is a freeware physics trainer (dynamics exercise generator), dealing with pulley systems. There are 15 kind of such systems (i.e. 15 kinds of exercises) available and the user may choose via the "Options" menu, which systems to include in the exercise and which not. This not only allows to generate questions, depending on the user''s physics knowledge, but also to concentrate on exercises, where the user knows to have diffculties with.'
      ''
      'To do an exercise, choose the number of questions (default = 10) in the "Options > Number of questions..." menu, select the kind of pulley systems, you want to have questions about, in the "Options > Pulley systems" menu, then choose "New" in the "Test" menu. The "Start" button now becomes accessible and pushing it, opens a new window with the first question. To continue the exercise, alternately push "Next" (in the main window) to generate a question and "Answer" (in the exercise window) to check your answer. To leave an exercise, without doing all questions, push the "Abort" button in the main window. If your answer is false, you may view the correct one, by pushing the "Show" button, before leaving the exercise window (with the "Close" button).'

      'The application checks all values, you enter, on 3 decimal digits, values supposed to be rounded. Note, however, that the values used in calculations are supposed to be the "full values" (at least 7 decimal digits). Thus, if you calculate the tension from the acceleration, calculated before, you may enter the acceleration with 3 decimal digits, but have to use the 7.. digits acceleration value to calculate the tension.'

      'For user conveniance, it''s possible to set the acceleration due to gravity (g) in the "Options" menu. Beside the common 9.8 m/s2, you may set it to 9.81 m/s2 (as is usual in Western Europe) or 10 m/s2 (unrealistic value for calculations simplification).'

      'and resolving the exercises consists of considering the block masses and the forces (in this case the tensions of the ropes) and construct a free-body diagram for each block. In the case of a block moving along a surface, the force due to kinetic friction has to be considered (unless it is neglected). Some exercises do not neglect the mass of the pulley; have a look in a physics book to see how to proceed in this case. You may also visit the websites, mentionned below; you''ll find detailed descriptions on how to resolve a given pulley system.'
