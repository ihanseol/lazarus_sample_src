      '"NetworkShow" is a network tool for MS Windows, that may be used to show the computers actually present on the (local) network. The application is not an IP-scanner; it doesn''t check subnets, but only those IP addresses, indicated in the network description file used. To determine if a given computer is actually "alive" or "dead", the program runs the Ping command line tool, included with Windows.'

Note, that using Arp, only the MAC addresses of the network-cards connected to the card of the computer, where "NetworkShow" is running, may be determined. Thus, if the network has several subnets, connected by a router, the MAC addresses for the computers on these other subnet(s) will not be shown. Also, Arp seems not to find the MAC of VMware network adapters.'

The DNS server used is the one defined in the network-card configuration. The reason, why there is a DNS server specified in the description file, is that without a DNS server running, it''s not possible to resolve the hosts'' names. Thus, the application checks the state of the host with the IP specified as DNS server in the file; if it''s not alive, NsLookup is not run.'
