"Decay1" program help.
**********************

"Decay1" is a nuclear physics application, generating exercises concerning radioactive decay, more precisely asking the user to find the equation for a given decay type of a given isotope.

Menu item "File".

Start a new exercise, with a number of questions as selected (default = 10).

Menu item "Settings".
=====================

Number of questions.
--------------------
User entry of the number of questions, the exercise should have (minimum 5). This option only becomes active, after choosing "New" in the "File" menu.

Display decay description.
--------------------------
Toggle to display or not a 1-sentence description of the decay types (default = no).

Enable isotope buttons.
-----------------------
Toggle or not to enable the "parent isotope" and "daughter isotope" buttons (default = no).
These buttons concern the decay equation. When disabled, the user has to enter the two isotopes all manually; when enabled, this entry into the equation field is done automatically (cf. "Entering the decay formula" below).

Equations display format.
-------------------------
The decay equations, as they appear in most physics texts, use the formula of the helium nucleus (2He-4) to describe the α-particle; you may change this by checking the "Use α instead of helium nucleus" option.
For β- and β+ decay, physics books often do the contrary as for α decay and use β- for the electron and β+ for the positron. You may want to change this: simply check "Use e-/e+ instead of β-/β+". Note, that in the ε (EC) decay equation, the electron is always written as e-.

Doing the exercises.
====================

Push the "Question" button to generate a question, i.e. to display the parent isotope and the decay type (α, β-, β+, ε). Fill in the atomic number (number of protons), the mass number and the number of neutrons for the isotope. Isotopes are displayed as X-nnn, where X is the chemical element's symbol and nnn the mass number of the actual isotope (one of several existing or synthetically created isotopes of a given element). Starting from this isotope and considering the decay type, determine Z, A and N and the symbol (remember that you have to use a Y-mmm notation) of the daughter isotope. Then, enter the decay equation and push the "Answer" button to check your answers.
Any field with a wrong value will be highlighted in red; a "correct" or "false" icon at the left of the button indicates the global evaluation of your answer and the evaluation counters are updated.
You may use the "Show" button to display the correct answer (with the equation re-formatted; see below). Note, that "Show" only reacts after you have pushed the "Answer" button.

Entering the decay equation.
============================

Most symbols used in he decay equations have no corresponding key on an ordinary PC-keyboard; you may use the buttons below the equation field instead.
α, β-, β+ particles are entered with the corresponding button. For the electron captured during ε decay, use the "electron" button. Neutrinos will be displayed in the equation as v, antineutrinos as ṽ.
The parent and daughter isotope have to be entered with Z and A specified (N ignored, as just being A - Z); use the format ZX-A (without any spaces and X representing the element symbol). When displaying the equation with the "Show" button, the display of the nuclide is somewhat prettier, Z being written as subscript, as it usually is; writing A as superscript at the left of the element symbol, as it should be, is actually not implemented.
With default settings, you have to enter the isotopes all manually. You can choose to do this with a simple button push by checking the "Enable isotope buttons" option. The nuclide entered will be ZX-A, with Z and A taken from the corresponding edit fields and X being the element symbol part of the value in the isotope edit field.
