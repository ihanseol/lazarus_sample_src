This means, that the application can only run correctly, if the data in this file is correct. This is particularily true for the data concerning your home city. In fact, the only information, that "Clock" does not look up in the file, is the actual local time. It''s from this time and based on the UTC-Offset value in the config file, that UTC time is calculated. And the so calculated UTC time is then used to calculated the time for the 8 world cities, listed in the file. This means, that, when configuring the application, and enter erroneous data concerning the UTC-Offset or (if daylight saving is used in your timezone) concerning DST, all time indications will be erroneous!'
      'Another approach would have been to use the time zone settings of the Windows operating system to calculate UTC. But, as first UTC/DST data has to be configured for the other cities anyway, and second the config file method is absolutely sure to always work, I preferred doing it this way.'
      'Simplifying the configuration file by specifying a timezone instead of detailed information would also be a possibility. There is a timezone related unit for Free Pascal. But, here again, with all details in the file correct, the time indications displayed will be correct for any cities and independently of any changes whatever.'

      'To remove a city from the display, just set its name to "empty". To use different cities, replace the data in the file. Note, that you can''t use more than 8 cities and that local time and UTC time is always displayed.'
      'Also, you should not alter the data for City0 manually. This is your home city information and you should enter it, using "Configuration ..." in the "Settings" menu. If you edit the data manually, please note, that for City0, the DST offset is mandatory; if daylight saving doesn''t apply its value must be set equal to the UTC offset.'
