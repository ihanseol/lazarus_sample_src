"lspics" is a simple command line program, that copies the pictures, that MS
Windows displays on the lock screen to a user directory.

Usage: lspics [SAVE-DIRECTORY] [OPTIONS]

SAVE-DIRECTORY : Full path to the folder, where the pictures should be saved.
                 If no folder is given, the folder "Lockscreen" in the user's
                 Pictures library will be used. The aliases UserDocs and
				 UserPics may be used to indicate the path to the user's
				 Documents resp. Pictures library.

OPTIONS: -r:FILENAME-BASE[,FILENAME-NUMBERING]] : Picture file renaming.
         Names to be used, when renaming the picture files. Filenames will
         be FILENAME-BASE, followed by a sequence number of the same format
         (left-filling with zeros) as FILENAME-NUMBERING and starting with
         the number given by FILENAME-NUMBERING.
         If the -r parameter is omitted, "pic,001" will be used.

         -o : Existing files overriding.
         The files found in the Microsoft folder are copied to the specified
         folder, with renaming as described above, plus addition of the
         extension .jpg. If a filename already exists, the actual file will
         NOT be copied. To allow file overriding, use the -o option.
