"LANMsgServer" and "LANMsgClient" started in December 2023 as sample Lazarus/Free Pascal programs, intended to show how you
can use the lNet library components to create a simple client-server application. With the new version 2.0 (May 2025), they
have somehow become "real applications"...

For details, please have a look at my tutorial "Introduction to network programming using Lazarus/Free Pascal"
at https://www.streetinfo.lu/computing/lazarus/project/network_intro.html.
