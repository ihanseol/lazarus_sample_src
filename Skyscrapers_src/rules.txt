There are several sets of rules for the Skyscrapers number puzzle, that exists in different variations. The rules used in the "Skyscrapers" PC application are those most commonly used.

 1. The grid fields contain skygrapers, represented by a number, that indicates there relative height.
 2. In each grid row and each grid column, a given height must occure exactly once.
 3. The numbers at the borders indicate, how many skygrapers you can see, if you look from this point into a row or column.
 4. A skygraper is only then visible, if all buildings in front of it are less in height.

Common rule extensions (not implemented in "Skyscrapers v1.0") are that the heights must also be unique in diagonal lines and that there may be fields with 0 (representing a park between the buildings).
