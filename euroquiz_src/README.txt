This is an example of using the mouse in a Free Pascal program on DOS (cf. the tutorial
"Implementing mouse support in a Free Pascal DOS program" at
https://www.streetinfo.lu/computing/lazarus/programming/dos_mouse.html).
It is intended to run on a native DOS operating system, not in Windows Command Prompt.
The program runs fine on FreeDOS; to run it on MS-DOS, DOS Protected Mode Interface (DPMI)
must be installed (cf. the tutorial "Running 32-bit applications on DOS" at
https://www.streetinfo.lu/computing/sysadmin/dos/dos_32bit.html).
