      'The "Equilibrium" application generates physics exercises, that consist in calculating the horizontal (E-W) and vertical (N-S) force that balance the force or forces acting upon an object (if this object is at rest, this situation is called a static equilibrium). The program gives the magnitude and angle of the acting forces, the student has to find the magnitude and the angle of the net force, the force that balances this force, and the corresponding E-W and N-S forces. Please, note that all values have to be entered with 3 significant digital digits and that all angles have to be given in the interval [0°, 360°[.'
